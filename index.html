            <h2>Why UX/UI?</h2>
            <p>To me, UX/UI is also about creating a space where people navigate but has much faster pace with less limitations compared to architecture and access to broader types of users. </br></br>My main goal of design has always been about how to provide the best experience to the users of my design. Even though the mediums of architecture and UX/UI are different as physical vs virtual, there are many similarities as solving problems and creating a comfortable space. </p>
